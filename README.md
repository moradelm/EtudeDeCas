In this project, I conducted a comparative analysis of REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and gRPC, focusing on the performance of CRUD operations. Using Apache JMeter, I measured key metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization for each API framework. This analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, providing valuable insights into selecting the most suitable framework for specific use cases and performance requirements.
